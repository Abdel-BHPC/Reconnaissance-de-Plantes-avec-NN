# RPlants Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network

# First Part

The objective in this first part is to explore and implement an algorithm of plant recognition through a convolutional neural network: Using the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm.
Initially, we have a data set of 3655 images of flowers, forming 5 different classes. This allows us to learn a classifier and generate a model capable of classifying our images.

# Second Part
Our objective in this second part is to optimize our code in order to improve performance by using parallelization and vectorization tools (OpenMP, MPI ..).
